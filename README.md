Even though majority of the college organisation work has been transformed, the lecture timetable preparation is still manually done due to the underlying difficulties. The manual lecture-timetable scheduling is a limitation fulfilment problem in which we find a result that satisfies the given set of constraints.The process of preparing a timetable involves beneficial employment of resources which needs to be confronted each year by every educational institute. Most colleges have a number of different courses and each course has a number of subjects. Now there are limited faculties, each faculty teaching more than one subjects. So now the time table needed to schedule the faculty at provided time slots in such a way that their timings do not overlap and the time table schedule makes best use of all faculty subject demand. While scheduling, even the smallest constraints can take a lot of time and the case is even worse when the number of constraints or the amount of data to deal with increases. Other cases that can cause   problem is when the number of Faculties (Teaching Staff) are less, resulting in rescheduling of time table or they need to fill on empty seats urgently. In such cases automated timetable, scheduling can be a very convenient method for managing it in computers with algorithms also proving to be eco-friendly for no paperwork.
